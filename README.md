# MaidConnect-MERN-STACK
This project is a service-based web application aimed at connecting rural housemaids with urban households in need of domestic help. The goal is to create an inclusive digital platform where employers can easily find and hire trustworthy housemaids, while housemaids can gain verified employment opportunities and financial independence.
